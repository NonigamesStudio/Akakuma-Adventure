1,"Aku: Good morning, Mr. blacksmith. My name is Aku! I was stopping by to visit him before setting out on my way to my future adventure."
4,"Blacksmith: (Looks at Aku carefully) Good morning, young man. How can I help you?"
1,"Aku: I embark on a journey to the Old Woods, a place full of dangers and fantastic creatures. Do you think my sword is of any use?"
4,"Blacksmith: (Nods his head) I understand. The Old Woods are a place feared by even the most experienced warriors. The sword that you now carry is perfect to defend yourself from the dangers that lie in wait for you! Wait, that sword was your grandfather's! I would recognize her anywhere"
1,"Aku: If his name was Kiato, he always took care of me and gave it to me for when the time came to go out into the world!"
4,"Blacksmith: (Smiles) Oh, young Aku, how happy it makes me to see you well and above all to see this magnificent sword recover its days of glory! Go out into the world and conquer it."
